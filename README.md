DriftPy is the Python client for the [Drift](https://www.drift.trade/) protocol. It allows you to trade and fetch data from Drift using Python.

**[Read the full SDK documentation here!](https://drift-labs.github.io/driftpy/)**

## Installation

```
pip install driftpy
```

Note: requires Python >= 3.10.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️

**PLEASE**, do not use QuickNode free RPCs to subscribe to the Drift Client.

If you are using QuickNode, you *must* use `AccountSubscriptionConfig("demo")`, and you can only subscribe to 1 perp market and 1 spot market at a time.

Non-QuickNode free RPCs (including the public mainnet-beta url) can use `cached` as well.

Example setup for `AccountSubscriptionConfig("demo")`: 

```
    # This example will listen to perp markets 0 & 1 and spot market 0
    # If you are listening to any perp markets, you must listen to spot market 0 or the SDK will break

    perp_markets = [0, 1]
    spot_market_oracle_infos, perp_market_oracle_infos, spot_market_indexes = get_markets_and_oracles(perp_markets = perp_markets)

    oracle_infos = spot_market_oracle_infos + perp_market_oracle_infos

    drift_client = DriftClient(
        connection,
        wallet, 
        "mainnet",             
        perp_market_indexes = perp_markets,
        spot_market_indexes = spot_market_indexes,
        oracle_infos = oracle_infos,
        account_subscription = AccountSubscriptionConfig("demo"),
    )
    await drift_client.subscribe()
```
If you intend to use `AccountSubscriptionConfig("demo)`, you *must* call `get_markets_and_oracles` to get the information you need.

`get_markets_and_oracles` will return all the necessary `OracleInfo`s and `market_indexes` in order to use the SDK.

## SDK Examples

- `examples/` folder includes more examples of how to use the SDK including how to provide liquidity/become an lp, stake in the insurance fund, etc.

## Setting Up Dev Env

`bash setup.sh`
